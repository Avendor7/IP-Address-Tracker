                        Stephen Wiggins is the Boss Bacon. He calls all the shots inside the office. Why is he Boss Bacon? Because he's the <strong>BOSS</strong> and everything
                        is better with Bacon. Stephen Wiggins is a master at the server side of web applications and rules his area of experties like a Boss. He handles the
                        day to day operations as well as helps keep this site running. His work allows you to place orders, and see what it is we have in stock. He is the
                        one that ultimately makes the decision of what we sell and for how much. Make no mistake, Wiggins may be the <strong>BOSS</strong> Bacon but when the chips
                        are down and things need to get done, you'll find him with the rest of the team down in the trenches.
