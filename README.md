This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.15.1.

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.

## Install notes

1. make sure Ruby is installed with the compass gem 'gem install compass'
2. copy 'waterlock' and 'waterlock-local-auth' from another computer (TODO, put these in the repo). For some reason these fail to install on newer installs.
